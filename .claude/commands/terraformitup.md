Great. Now in a new directory called ’terraform’, build the terraform we would need to build and deploy the lambda in the lambda directory, and all the associated infrastructure, including the dynamo db table, logging infrastructure and all IAM permissions the lambda needs in the us-east-1 region. Make sure you build the required v2 API Gateway for the function. The gateway should have a custom domain name of $ARGUMENTS-srnext.steverhoton.com. steverhoton.com already exists in the account (and can be imported as a data resource), but you will need to set up the needed DNS records and ACM certificates. Make sure the gateway has a JWT authorizer, the IssuerURL for which is https://cognito-idp.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/us-east-1_plhb9FhBb (the coginito configuration can be looked at via the aws cli). Follow the terraform rules in your memory. Deploy the lambda directly through terraform, and do not use scripts. Do not build modules. Use the existing bucket ‘srhoton-tfstate’, but do not use dynamodb locking. All your terraform should format, lint (and conform to tflint-ruleset-aws), and validate. This is building into a dev environment. Ultrathink, and let me know what questions you have.
