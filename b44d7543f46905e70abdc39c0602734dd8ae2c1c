User Request:
What I would like to do is the following:

1. Create a directory called 'dev-container'
2. In that directory I want to Create a dev container for a GitHub codespace. The container should have the following installed:
- Java 21 Corretto
- Python > 3.11, with venv and uv (not pip)
- Golang latest
- aws cli
- starship command line tool
- Node latest, npm, and typescript support

Implementation:
Created a comprehensive dev container setup in dev-container/.devcontainer/ with:
- devcontainer.json for VS Code/Codespaces configuration
- Dockerfile with all requested tools and runtimes
- setup.sh for post-creation customization
- README.md with complete documentation

All tools installed and verified, ready for GitHub Codespaces or local Dev Containers usage.
