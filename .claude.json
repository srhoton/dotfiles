Different field naming to avoid reserved keywords\n\n  Location of Issue:\n\n  This is happening in the resolver lambda or BFF layer that handles the listEventsByStatus GraphQL query. The issue is in the DynamoDB query\n  construction, not in the UI code.\n\n  What the Backend Team Needs to Fix:\n\n  The DynamoDB query in the listEventsByStatus resolver needs to be updated to handle the reserved keyword status properly. Instead of:\n\n  // BROKEN - uses reserved keyword directly\n  FilterExpression: \"status = :statusValue\"\n\n  It should use:\n\n  // FIXED - uses expression attribute names\n  FilterExpression: \"#status = :statusValue\",\n  ExpressionAttributeNames: {\n      \"#status\": \"status\"\n  }\n\n  Recommendation:\n\n  Have the backend team check the listEventsByStatus resolver implementation and update it to properly escape the status field name using\n  DynamoDB Expression Attribute Names.\n\n  The UI code is correct - this is a backend infrastructure issue that needs to be resolved in the GraphQL resolver or DynamoDB query layer."

The issues are:\n\n  1. Overly Strict Validation: The mutation should allow partial updates (just changing status) without requiring all fields that might be needed\n   for event creation\n  2. Conditional Schema Logic: The if/then validation logic is too restrictive for status-only updates\n  3. Required Fields Mismatch: maintenanceDetails should not be required when simply updating an event's status\n\n  Recommended Backend Fix\n\n  The backend team should modify the UpdateEventInput validation to:\n\n  1. Make conditional fields optional for status updates\n  2. Separate validation rules for different types of updates (creation vs status change)\n  3. Allow minimal updates when only changing status field\n\n  Example fix pattern:\n  // Current (broken): Requires all fields for any update\n  // Should be: Allow partial updates for status changes\n\n  if (input.status && !input.maintenanceDetails) {\n    // Allow status-only updates without requiring maintenance details\n  }\n\n  Temporary Workaround\n\n  If you need immediate testing, you could temporarily modify our frontend to send a minimal maintenanceDetails object, but this is not\n  recommended as it's a backend validation issue.\n\n  Summary for Backend Team\n\n  Issue: updateEvent mutation validation is too strict for status-only updatesLocation: Event validation schema in the BFF GraphQL resolverError:\n   Conditional validation requiring maintenanceDetails for all updatesFix: Allow partial updates when only changing event statusPriority: High -\n  breaks the archive functionality in Triage Center\n\n  The frontend code is correct - this is purely a backend validation logic issue that needs to be resolved by the BFF team."

Looking at the schema I reviewed earlier:\n\n  type Event {\n    workOrderIds: [String!]!  # This is non-nullable - cannot be null\n    # ... other fields\n  }\n\n  Root Cause:\n\n  The backend is returning null for the workOrderIds field, but the GraphQL schema declares it as non-nullable. This creates a schema validation\n  error.\n\n  Location of Issue:\n\n  This is happening in the resolver lambda or database layer where existing Event records don't have the workOrderIds field populated, or the\n  resolver is explicitly returning null instead of an empty array.\n\n  What the Backend Team Needs to Fix:\n\n  The backend team needs to ensure that:\n\n  1. Existing Event records in the database have workOrderIds set to an empty array [] instead of null or missing\n  2. The resolver always returns an empty array [] for events that don't have work orders assigned, rather than null\n\n  Two Possible Solutions:\n\n  Option 1 (Recommended): Fix the data/resolver\n\n  - Update existing Event records to have workOrderIds: [] instead of null\n  - Ensure the resolver always returns [] for empty work order lists\n\n  Option 2: Update the schema\n\n  - Change the schema to allow nullable: workOrderIds: [String!] (remove the outer !)\n  - This would be a breaking change and require UI updates\n\n  Recommendation:\n\n  Have the backend team:\n  1. Data migration: Update existing Event records to set workOrderIds: [] where it's currently null\n  2. Resolver fix: Ensure the resolver returns [] instead of null when no work orders are assigned\n\n  This is a backend data consistency issue, not a UI problem.\n"

Different field naming to avoid reserved keywords\n\n  Location of Issue:\n\n  This is happening in the resolver lambda or BFF layer that handles the listEventsByStatus GraphQL query. The issue is in the DynamoDB query\n  construction, not in the UI code.\n\n  What the Backend Team Needs to Fix:\n\n  The DynamoDB query in the listEventsByStatus resolver needs to be updated to handle the reserved keyword status properly. Instead of:\n\n  // BROKEN - uses reserved keyword directly\n  FilterExpression: \"status = :statusValue\"\n\n  It should use:\n\n  // FIXED - uses expression attribute names\n  FilterExpression: \"#status = :statusValue\",\n  ExpressionAttributeNames: {\n      \"#status\": \"status\"\n  }\n\n  Recommendation:\n\n  Have the backend team check the listEventsByStatus resolver implementation and update it to properly escape the status field name using\n  DynamoDB Expression Attribute Names.\n\n  The UI code is correct - this is a backend infrastructure issue that needs to be resolved in the GraphQL resolver or DynamoDB query layer."

              "content": "⏺ Lambda Bug Report: Events Query Operations Failing with Interface Conversion Error\n\n  Summary\n\n  The events lambda function (steverhoton-events-handler-prod) is experiencing interface conversion errors when handling GraphQL query operations\n  (getEvent, listEventsByUnit), while mutation operations (createEvent) work correctly.\n\n  Error Details\n\n  - Error Type: TypeAssertionError\n  - Error Message: interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not string\n  - Stack Trace Location: lambda/main.go:104 in (*Handler).handleGetEvent\n  - Affected Operations: All query operations (getEvent, listEventsByUnit, listEventsByCategory, etc.)\n  - Working Operations: All mutation operations (createEvent, updateEvent, deleteEvent)\n\n  Symptoms\n\n  1. getEvent queries return:\n  {\n    \"data\": { \"getEvent\": null },\n    \"errors\": [{\n      \"errorType\": \"Lambda:Unhandled\",\n      \"message\": \"interface conversion: interface {} is nil, not string\"\n    }]\n  }\n  2. listEventsByUnit queries return:\n  {\n    \"data\": { \"listEventsByUnit\": null },\n    \"errors\": [{\n      \"message\": \"Cannot return null for non-nullable type: 'null' within parent 'EventListOutput' (/listEventsByUnit/items)\"\n    }]\n  }\n\n  Root Cause Analysis\n\n  The error occurs at lambda/main.go:104 in the handleGetEvent function, suggesting the lambda is attempting to cast a nil interface{} value to a\n  string. This likely indicates:\n\n  1. Missing or malformed input parameters - The lambda expects certain string parameters that are coming through as nil\n  2. AppSync resolver template issue - The request template may not be properly passing required parameters to the lambda\n  3. Input validation bug - The lambda may not be properly handling cases where expected string fields are missing\n\n  Reproduction Steps\n\n  1. Send any GraphQL query operation to the events resolver:\n  query {\n    getEvent(input: {\n      accountId: \"e4c8f468-e0b1-7049-6f0f-48b0b4f27aa5\",\n      eventId: \"eba7e20a-1ef6-4cfa-855e-e75369cb2900\"\n    }) {\n      eventId\n      eventCategory\n      eventType\n    }\n  }\n  2. Observe the interface conversion error in CloudWatch logs\n  3. Note that mutations work fine with the same account/event IDs\n\n  Suggested Investigation\n\n  1. Check lambda code at line 104 in handleGetEvent function for unsafe type assertions\n  2. Verify AppSync request template is properly passing all required parameters\n  3. Add input validation and proper error handling for nil values\n  4. Compare working mutation logic with failing query logic to identify differences\n\n  Workaround\n\n  Mutation operations (createEvent, updateEvent, deleteEvent) are functioning correctly, so write operations can continue while query operations are\n  fixed.\n\n  Priority: Medium-High\n\n  Query operations are essential for reading event data, making this a significant functional limitation despite mutations working correctly."

The lambda receives empty `typeName` and `fieldName` values despite being correctly passed from AppSync resolvers.\n\n## Environment\n\n- **Lambda Function:** `labor-lines-prod-labor-lines-handler`\n- **AppSync API:** `iqq7mdchxraw7oy6onvguwwtjy` (steverhoton-bff-api)\n- **GraphQL Endpoint:** `https://moh56rmnyvbflo4owbti2tioay.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql`\n- **Region:** us-east-1\n\n## Problem Description\n\n### Expected Behavior\nWhen invoking GraphQL mutations/queries for labor lines (e.g., `createLaborLine`), the lambda should:\n1. Receive the correct `typeName` (\"Mutation\") and `fieldName` (\"createLaborLine\") \n2. Process the operation successfully\n3. Return valid labor line data\n\n### Actual Behavior\nThe lambda consistently returns:\n```json\n{\n  \"error\": {\n    \"message\": \"unsupported operation: \",\n    \"type\": \"UnsupportedOperation\"\n  }\n}\n```\n\n## Reproduction Steps\n\n1. Authenticate with Cognito to get access token\n2. Execute GraphQL mutation:\n   ```graphql\n   mutation {\n     createLaborLine(input: {\n       accountId: \"test-123\",\n       taskId: \"task-456\", \n       contactId: \"contact-789\",\n       partId: [\"part-001\"],\n       notes: [\"Test note\"]\n     }) {\n       laborLineId\n       accountId\n       taskId\n       contactId\n     }\n   }\n   ```\n3. Observe error response with null data and non-nullable field errors\n\n## Investigation Findings\n\n### Lambda Logs Analysis\n- **Log Group:** `/aws/lambda/labor-lines-prod-labor-lines-handler`\n- **Log Message:** `Processing AppSync event: .`\n- **Issue:** The period (.) indicates both `typeName` and `fieldName` are empty\n\n### Event Structure Comparison\n\n**Expected by Lambda (based on source code):**\n```json\n{\n  \"typeName\": \"Mutation\",\n  \"fieldName\": \"createLaborLine\",\n  \"arguments\": {...},\n  \"identity\": {...},\n  \"source\": {...},\n  \"request\": {...},\n  \"info\": {\n    \"fieldName\": \"createLaborLine\",\n    \"parentTypeName\": \"Mutation\",\n    \"variables\": {...},\n    \"selectionSetList\": [...]\n  },\n  \"prev\": {...}\n}\n```\n\n**Actually Received by Lambda:**\n```json\n{\n  \"typeName\": \"\",  // Empty string\n  \"fieldName\": \"\", // Empty string\n  \"arguments\": {...},\n  // ... rest of structure appears correct\n}\n```\n\n### AppSync VTL Template\nThe AppSync request template correctly maps the context:\n```vtl\n{\n  \"version\": \"2017-02-28\",\n  \"operation\": \"Invoke\",\n  \"payload\": {\n    \"typeName\": $util.toJson($context.info.parentTypeName),\n    \"fieldName\": $util.toJson($context.info.fieldName),\n    \"arguments\": $util.toJson($context.arguments),\n    // ... additional fields\n  }\n}\n```\n\n### Direct Lambda Testing\nDirect lambda invocation with identical event structure also fails, suggesting the issue is within the lambda function itself, not the AppSync integration.\n\n## Root Cause Analysis\n\nThe lambda's `AppSyncEvent` struct expects:\n```go\ntype AppSyncEvent struct {\n    TypeName   string                 `json:\"typeName\"`\n    FieldName  string                 `json:\"fieldName\"`\n    // ... other fields\n}\n```\n\nHowever, the lambda is receiving empty values for these critical fields, causing the switch statement in `HandleAppSyncEvent` to fall through to the default case with an empty `event.FieldName`.\n\n## Possible Causes\n\n1. **Lambda Code Issue:** The JSON unmarshaling might not be working correctly\n2. **Event Structure Mismatch:** The lambda expects a different event format than what AppSync provides\n3. **Deployment Issue:** The deployed lambda version might be different from the source code\n4. **Runtime Issue:** Go runtime JSON parsing issue with the specific field names\n\n## Affected Operations\n\nAll labor lines GraphQL operations are impacted:\n- ✗ `createLaborLine` (Mutation)\n- ✗ `updateLaborLine` (Mutation)  \n- ✗ `deleteLaborLine` (Mutation)\n- ✗ `getLaborLine` (Query)\n- ✗ `listLaborLines` (Query)\n\n## Impact\n\n- **Severity:** High - Complete failure of labor lines functionality\n- **User Impact:** Unable to manage labor line assignments through GraphQL API\n- **Workarounds:** None available through GraphQL API\n\n## Recommended Actions\n\n### Immediate (High Priority)\n1. **Debug Lambda Event Processing:** Add detailed logging in the lambda to capture the exact event structure received\n2. **Verify Deployment:** Confirm the deployed lambda matches the expected source code\n3. **Test Event Parsing:** Add unit tests for the `AppSyncEvent` struct unmarshaling\n\n### Short Term\n1. **Update Lambda Logging:** Enhanced logging to capture full event payload for debugging\n2. **Event Structure Validation:** Add validation to ensure required fields are present\n3. **Error Handling:** Improve error messages to provide more diagnostic information\n\n### Long Term  \n1. **Integration Tests:** Implement automated tests for AppSync → Lambda integration\n2. **Event Format Documentation:** Document the exact event format expected by the lambda\n3. **Monitoring:** Add CloudWatch metrics for lambda success/failure rates\n\n## Test Cases for Verification\n\nOnce fixed, verify with these test cases:\n\n```bash\n# Test 1: Create Labor Line\ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"query\": \"mutation { createLaborLine(input: {accountId: \\\"test\\\", taskId: \\\"task\\\", contactId: \\\"contact\\\"}) { laborLineId } }\"}' \\\n  https://moh56rmnyvbflo4owbti2tioay.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql\n\n# Test 2: List Labor Lines  \ncurl -X POST \\\n  -H \"Authorization: Bearer $TOKEN\" \\\n  -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" \\\n  -d '{\"query\": \"query { listLaborLines(input: {accountId: \\\"test\\\"}) { laborLineId } }\"}' \\\n  https://moh56rmnyvbflo4owbti2tioay.appsync-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/graphql\n```\n\n## Additional Information\n\n- **AppSync GraphQL Schema:** Successfully deployed with all labor lines types and operations\n- **IAM Permissions:** Correctly configured for AppSync → Lambda invocation\n- **Lambda Function:** Accessible and responding, but with incorrect event processing\n- **Related Systems:** Other lambda resolvers (events, parts, contacts) work correctly with similar patterns\n\n## Files for Reference\n\n- **GraphQL Schema:** `terraform/labor_lines_query.graphql`\n- **Resolver Config:** `terraform/labor_lines_query.tf`  \n- **Lambda Source:** `steverhoton-labor-lines/lambda/` (external repository)\n- **Test Scripts:** `test_labor_lines_graphql.sh`, `simple_test.sh`\n\n---\n\n**Next Steps:** Coordinate with the labor lines lambda development team to resolve the event processing issue."

Missing return statement - Lambda may not be returning the processed data\n  2. Incorrect response format - Response structure doesn't match AppSync expectations\n  3. Serialization issue - Data is processed but not properly serialized for AppSync\n\n  Recommended Fix\n\n  Ensure lambda operations return properly formatted responses that match the GraphQL schema:\n\n  // Example expected response format for createTask\n  return &model.Task{\n      TaskID:      createdTask.TaskID,\n      AccountID:   createdTask.AccountID,\n      WorkOrderID: createdTask.WorkOrderID,\n      ContactID:   createdTask.ContactID,\n      Status:      createdTask.Status,\n      // ... all required fields\n  }, nil\n\n  Testing\n\n  All operations can be tested via GraphQL mutations/queries.

Add Debug Logging:\n  // In handler code, add logging before DynamoDB operations\n  log.Printf(\"About to save task to DynamoDB: %+v\", task)\n\n  // After DynamoDB save\n  if err := h.repository.Create(ctx, task); err != nil {\n      log.Printf(\"DynamoDB save failed: %v\", err)\n      // existing error handling\n  } else {\n      log.Printf(\"DynamoDB save successful, returning task: %+v\", task)\n  }\n  3. Check Environment Variables:\n  aws lambda get-function-configuration --function-name maintenance-task-dev-lambda\n\n  Expected Lambda Response Format:\n  The lambda should return a response like:\n  {\n    \"task\": {\n      \"taskId\": \"uuid-here\",\n      \"accountId\": \"test-123\",\n      \"workOrderId\": \"wo-456\",\n      \"contactId\": \"contact-789\",\n      \"status\": \"pending\",\n      // ... other fields\n    }\n  }\n\n  Not:\n  {\n    \"task\": null\n  }\n  or\n  {\n    \"error\": { \"message\": \"some error\" }\n  }\n\n  Priority: Medium-High - The GraphQL integration works perfectly, but no task operations can complete successfully until the lambda returns\n   proper data.\n\n  Testing: Once fixed, create operations should return complete task objects with all required fields populated."

Change Claims to interface{} (Recommended):\n  type Identity struct {\n      Username string                    `json:\"username\"`\n      Claims   map[string]interface{}    `json:\"claims\"`  // ← Allow any type\n  }\n\n  2. Use json.Number (Alternative):\n  type Identity struct {\n      Username string                 `json:\"username\"`\n      Claims   map[string]json.Number  `json:\"claims\"`\n  }\n\n  3. Custom unmarshaling (More complex but handles all cases)\n\n  Impact: This prevents all task GraphQL operations from working, as the lambda fails to parse the request before reaching the business\n  logic.\n\n  Priority: Medium - The GraphQL infrastructure is deployed and working, but all operations fail due to this parsing issue.\n\n  Testing: Once fixed, all task operations (create, read, update, delete, list) should work correctly through the GraphQL API.\n"
